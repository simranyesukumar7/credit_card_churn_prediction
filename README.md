# Credit Card Churn Prediction

Customer churn is a term that is described as a percentage of customers who terminate or discontinue their ties with a firm or industry or with some services which means they no longer use the services of a particular company. It has been observed over the years that customers, especially in the banking industry, have numerous choices, and hence, they frequently shift from one credit card company to another whenever they find good deals or services. Hence, this leads to a churning rate of 13% in this competitive industrial market. 
It is impossible to keep the knowledge of every customer because these firms are huge and have a large number of customers hence, they cannot invest this much time with each customer. It will increase the cost which will eventually outweigh the revenue.  However, if a credit card company can predict which portion of their customers tends to leave them and then can shift all their customer retention efforts to these particular customers and hence, can reduce the overall churning rate of the bank. Generally, every company’s main agenda is to earn customer loyalty and expand its business. 
To identify early signs of churns, a bank must initially develop a comprehensive view of its clients and their interactions over different platforms which includes branch visits, purchase history of the product, and even interactions over social media, etc. This will result in maintaining a position in this competitive market and also let them challenge their competitors.  

**Objective** 

The main objectives of the project are as follows: 
Determining and visualizing the factors that are a major cause of customer churn in banks.
Building a prediction model that will not only determine if a client is going to churn or not but will also choose a model that will also connect a probability to the churn to make customer services aware of the high-risk clients so that they can function accordingly.
